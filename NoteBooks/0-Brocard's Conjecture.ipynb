    "## **Introduction**\n",
    "\n",
    "[Brocard's Conjecture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brocard%27s_conjecture) is a mathematical problem that poses an interesting relationship between prime numbers. Formulated by the French mathematician Henri Brocard, this conjecture states that there are always at least four prime numbers within the interval between two consecutive squares. In other words, if $p_n$ and $p_{n+1}$ are two consecutive prime numbers, then there will always be at least four prime numbers $p$ such that $p_n^2 < p < p_{n+1}^2$, for all $n â‰¥ 2$.\n",
    "\n",
    "## **Objective**\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook presents a program that allows the efficient search for prime numbers within a predefined range, starting from a given index. The implementation of this computational tool is mainly aimed at facilitating the exploration and analysis of prime number sequences in the context of Brocard's Conjecture. By automating the search process, the aim is to provide a flexible and versatile tool that can be used for various purposes related to [number theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Number_theory), including the identification of possible counterexamples to the Brocard Conjecture."

    "## **1. Efficient prime number search**\n",
    "\n",
    "The first step in the development of this program was to address the fundamental question: How to efficiently find prime numbers, taking into account computational limitations?\n",
    "\n",
    "To do so, we relied on the [Eratosthenes sieve algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sieve_of_Eratosthenes), recognized for its efficiency in finding all prime numbers less than a given integer. This algorithm is based on a straightforward and systematic strategy to identify prime numbers up to a certain limit by iteratively eliminating multiples of the numbers found.\n",
    "\n",
    "The idea behind the algorithm is as follows: \n",
    "\n",
    "1. You start with a list of numbers you want to evaluate (from 2 up to a given number, n).\n",
    "Mark the number 1 as non-prime and start from 2 as the first prime number.\n",
    "3. Go through the list starting from the first prime number (2) and eliminate its multiples, since these cannot be prime.\n",
    "4. We go to the next number not marked as non-prime, which will be the next prime number.\n",
    "5. The process is repeated until all the multiples of the prime numbers found have been marked or eliminated.\n",
    "\n",
    "The code resulting from this algorithm is presented below as the function `sieve_of_eratosthenes`, which takes as input an integer `n` and returns a list of all prime numbers less than `n`."

    "Note that the adaptation of the algorithm to Python presents a couple of optimization improvements given in the pseudo-code of [Sorenson (1990)](https://research.cs.wisc.edu/techreports/1990/TR909.pdf), the most prominent improvements being the limitation of the search range to the square root of the maximum number to be evaluated. This is because, if a composite number has a divisor greater than its square root, then it would also have another divisor less than its square root, implying that it would already have been marked as non-prime.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another key optimization is to avoid checking multiples of numbers already marked as non-prime more than once. This is achieved by modifying the iteration range in the inner loop to start from the square of the current number, rather than starting from twice the current number."
